<h1>SmartOCR - Advanced Image Processing for Tesseract OCR Engine</h1>


SmartOCR is an Android Native app that leverages the power of NDK (C++) for advanced image preprocessing, specifically Sauvola Thresholding/Binarization. This preprocessing significantly enhances the results of the Tesseract OCR engine, making it more effective for accurate optical character recognition.

<h1>Features ðŸš€</h1>

- NDK-powered Processing: SmartOCR extensively uses the NDK for optimized image preprocessing.

- Sauvola Thresholding: The app applies Sauvola Thresholding to enhance OCR results by effectively binarizing images.

- Tesseract OCR Integration: Seamlessly integrates with the Tesseract OCR engine for accurate and powerful optical character recognition.

<h1>Tech Stack ðŸ’»</h1>

- Android Native Development: Utilizes Android Native Development Kit (NDK) for efficient C++ processing.

- Tesseract OCR: Integrates the powerful Tesseract OCR engine for accurate text recognition.

- Unit & Instrumented tests with Espresso, Mockito, JUnit & AndroidX frameworks.
